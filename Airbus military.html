		The A400M is a military transport plane that was designed to replace the C-160 Transall and C-130 Hercules, it is slightly smaller than a C-17 Globemaster III
		but bigger than the C-130J Super Hercules. However it is also has been postpone from it's first sales due to an inability to carry the required weight of 32 tons
		instead it could only carry 29 tons of cargo. The South African Air Force has cancelled it's orders due to delays and costs. The A400M is 5 billion euros over
		budget and 3 to 4 years behind schedule. The United Kingdom has cut it's order from 25 planes to 22 and Germany went form 60 to 53. However on 2010 Britain, 
		Belgium, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain, and Turkey have agreed to lend Airbus 1.5 billion Euros for the project.

		In June 2009 Lockheed Martin said that both the United Kingdom and France have asked for technical details for the C-130J as an alternative to the A400M.
		It has been shown that the plane even has difficulty when it comes to refueling a helicopter mid-flight, a french aerospace laboratory ONERA claimed that it had
		succesfully trialled a 36.5m hose and drogue pipe in a wind tunnel for refuelling a helicopter but the spoilers required to slow the plane down to the required
		103-180KT speed. John Gilbert, Britain's former minister for defence procurement stated "The A400M is a complete, absolute wanking disaster, and we should be 
		ashamed of ourselves. I have never seen such a waste of public funds in the defence field since I have been involved in it these past 40 years."
		out of the total 174 orders only 53 have been delivered

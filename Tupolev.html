		The TU-144 is a Soviet-Russian designed plane and one of only two commercial supersonic planes, the other of course being the Anglo-Saxon designed
		Concorde. The first prototype flew on the 31 December 1968 two months before the first Concorde flight, on 5 June 1969 the TU-144 hit supersonic
		speeds for the first time and was the first plane to exceed Mach-2 on 26 May 1970. One of the largest reasons for the Soviets to make a supersonic
		jet was to show the western powers that communism was better than capitalism, however due to budget restrictions, cuts, and inferior engineering
		the planes was far inferior to the Concorde, this can easily be seen in the wings. Originally the jet was intended to have similar 
		delta wings to the Concorde (wings specifically designed to perform well at both supersonic and subsonic speeds) however because of bufget and 
		engineering restrictions the Soviets instead had to go with a wing that only performed well at supersonic speeds, this meant that to lift-off required
		massive amounts more fuel than the concorde or any other sub sonic jet because the wings just didn't have enough lift in slow speeds.

		Another design flaw was in the engines, the Concorde had twin Rolls-Royce/Snecma Olympus turbojets whereas the TU-144 uses two NK-144 turbofans, the Olympus 
		engineswere designed so that once the massive fuel burns to get to supersonic speed were done the plane only had to use similar amounts of fuel to a sub-sonic 
		jet to keep in super sonic speeds which massively decreased the amount of fuel used in flight, however the NK-144 still had to burn the same amount of fuel to 
		keep in super sonic speeds, this massively increased fuel cost.

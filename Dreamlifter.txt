		The Boeing 747-400 LCF, or Dreamlifter, is used by Boeing to carry Dreamliner parts from around the world to their assembly plants. The 747-400 LCF is
		a heavily modified Boeing 747-400 and it can hold three times the volume of a 747-400F (freighter). The Dreamlifter was originally designed because 
		787 parts were deemed too big for marine shipping containers as well as the 747-400f, Antonov AN-124 and Antonov AN-225. The Dreamlifter carries 787
		parts from Japan and Italy to North Charleston, South Carolina and eventually Washington state for final assembly.

		The Dreamlifter has a large, bulging fuselage similar to that of the Super Guppy or Airbus A300-600ST Beluga, this fuselage is bigger than marine
		shipping containers and the plane is faster than any truck, cargo ship, or train. The largest difference between the Dreamlifter and Beluga is that
		the Dreamlifter loads cargo from the tail instead of the nose. The Dreamlifter has a range of 4,200 nautical miles when fully loaded.

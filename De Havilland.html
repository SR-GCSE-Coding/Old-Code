		The De Havilland Comet is the world's first jet airliner, the first prototypeflew in 1949 as the Comet 1. It was made entireley of metal and had an 
		aerodynamic design with a pressurised cabin. It's cockpit had four seats and the plane usually had two pilots, a flight engineer, and a navigator.
		it's clean, low drag design had many features that were uncommon for the time including fuel tanks integrated into the wings and two pairs of turbojet
		engines that were inside of the wings. The Comet 1 had a similar length to the Boeing 737-100 but less seats with more spacious areas. Each seat had
		it's own lifejacket and there were life rafts in the wings.

		The De Havilland Comet waspowered by four De Havilland Ghost turbojets which had a maximum thrust of 5000 pounds of thrust at 10250 rpm. The engine 
		was designed specifically for the Comet so that the plane could meet the requirements of the brabazon commitee's recommendation of a pressurised transatlantic
		that could carry 1 long ton non stop at a cruising speed of 400 mph.

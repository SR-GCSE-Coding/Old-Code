	<h3>
		Beluga
	</h3>

	<br>
		The Beluga was developed when Airbus realized it needed a larger transport plane to move the parts of other aircraft to the final production line.
		At the tiem Airbus had been using a fleet of Boeing "Super Guppys" were used.
	<br>

	<br>
		It was this plane that it was based on which was in turn based on the earlier
		"Pregnant Guppy". Boeing even made an offer to convert several 767's for the job but Airbus instead decided to make a modified A300-600.
		Several other planes were also suggested some being the: Mcdonnell Douglass C-17 Globemaster 3, the Antonov 225 and Lockheed C-5 Galaxy.
		Overall the Beluga as a volume was increased by over 30% and the payload more than doubled from it's Supe Guppy predecessors.

	<br>
	
		The Beluga's first test flight was on 1994 and it recieved EASA certification on 1995 and Airbus has announced that a new fleet of Bluga 2's 
		will be developed and based on the large A330-200. Five of these new Belugas will be operating from 2019 and the last old beluga will be replaced in 2025.
		The A300-600ST Beluga has a storage compartment that is 7.7M in diameter, the unloading mechanism is performed by a large door above the cockpit
		which was moved down. This is to increase loading and unloading speeds. And it works because the time spent loading and unloading has been reported
		as only one-third of the time it took for the super guppy to finish.

		However the Beluga is not perfect, although it's cargo hold is one of the biggest to exist outclassing that of the  the C-5 Galaxy or
		the Antonov AN-124 it is still outclassed by the Antonov AN-225 and can only carry 47 tonnes compared to 122.5 tonnes for the C-5, 150 tonnes for the AN-124,
		and 640 tonnes for the AN-225.

	<h3>
		A380
	</h3>

		The Airbus A380 is a double-decker, wide-body aircraft. It is the largest commercial passenger plane designed to date. It was originally designed to
		challenge Boeing's monopoly on the large aircraft market. It has a floor space of 550 square metres, and it can carry up to 853 passengers in an all 
		economy configuration. Airbus announced it's plans to design the plane in June of 1994, designating the plane the "A3XX". The A380 has a range of 
		8,500 nautical miles, it can fly from New York to Sydney non-stop with 555 passengers. The plane has two passenger cabins, in an all economy 
		configuration the plane can carry 538 passengers on the bottom deck and 315 on the upper deck.

		The plane is powered by either 4 Rolls-Royce Trent 900 or 4 Engine Alliance GP7000 turbofans. While these engines aren't the most efficient, they are 
		much quiter than the engines on the Boeing 747, Lufthansa's A380s have half the noise footprint of the 747-200 despite carrying 160 morepassengers. Due
		to how quiet the A380 is, Airbus recieved an award from the Noise Abatement Society, and can also land an A380 at London Heathrow for less price than
		a Boeing 747, despite being much larger than one. The A380 can save £4,800 to £5,200 when landing at Heathrow compared to the 747. Currently, Airbus has
		recieved 331 orders and delivered 222 planes.

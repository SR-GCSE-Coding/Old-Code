	<p>
		The Boeing 247 is widely considered to be the first modern aeroplane and the first aircraft to fully incorporate such advances as a fully metal Anodized
		Aluminium semi-monocoque fuselage, a fully cantilevered wing and retractable landing gear. The Boeing 247 was able to fly to a maximum altitude of 3,500m
		at a speed of 200 mph. The Boeing-247 could hold a maximum of 14 passengers and was the first plane that could fly with only one engine. The engines were dual
		Pratt & Whitney R-1340 wasp engines.

		When Boeing decided to release the plane from it's test and development phase they entered it in the 1934 MacRobertson air race from Britain to Australia to show
		off how good the plane was. In the race the plane was piloted by Colonel Roscoe Turner and Clyde Pangborn under the race number "57". Turner and Pangborn came 
		third overall in the race and second in the transport sector, they were unfortunately beaten by the Mcdonell Douglass DC-2 which would eventually become it's 
		it's biggest rival.

	<p>
		The Boeing-377 is a large long-range airliner developed from the C-97 military transport "Stratofreighter", this itself was based on the B-29 Bomber. The 377 
		first flew on July 8, 1947. On November 29, 1945 Pan America World Airways became the launch customer by buying 20 StratoCruisers at a price of $24,500,000.
		the 377 first flew on July 8, 1947 two years after the first commercial order. the 377 had the same design as the C-97 using a "double Bubble" fuselage, this
		looked like a figuree of 8 in the cross-section.

		The 377 had 187M3 of space, this design also allowed for the pressurization of a large cabin with two passenger decks. The lower deck served as a lounge that
		had room for 14 people and the other deck was a main deck that could seat 100 people. The plane was powered by 4 Pratt & Whitney R-4360 engines with 
		superchargers, these superchargers allowed for increased power at a high altitude and and a constant cabin pressure. Over-all the 377 was larger than
		the Douglass DC-6 and Lockheed Constellation, however it was also more expensive and unreliable due to problems with the 28 cylinder R-4360 Radial engines.
		Only 55 were built including the prototype.

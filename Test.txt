<h1>The Wright Flyer</h1>
<p>The Wright Flyer was the first succesful heavier than air powered aircraft. The aircraft was made from timber and fabric. The entire frame of the plane, including the propellors were madeby hand.</p>
<p>The plane was powered by a crude gasoline engine that the Wright brothers got their employer to make, this was because there were no suitable engines at the time for their plane. The Wright Flyer was a bicanard biplane, this meant it just had some extra, smaller wings to give extra lift and help in control of the plane.</p>
<p>The Wright Flyer was a modified version of the Wright Brother's 1902 glider. They assembled it at Kitty Hawk</p>
